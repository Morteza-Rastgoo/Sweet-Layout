# Sweet-Layout

Implement `Sweet alert dialog` [https://github.com/pedant/sweet-alert-dialog] loading and the thick view in our custom layout.


I've created this library to include sweet alert animations in any desired layout based on this stack question asked by me [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33708914/how-to-implement-sweet-alert-loading-and-the-thick-view-in-our-layout].
